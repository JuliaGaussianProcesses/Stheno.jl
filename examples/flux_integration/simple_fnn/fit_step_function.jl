# Stheno and Flux have slightly different conventions regarding their data. In particular

#   observation.
# - Stheno assumes that you'll provide an `AbstractVector`, where each element is an
#   observation. To handle multi-dimensional inputs we have the `ColVecs` object, that
#   literally just wraps a `Matrix` and tells Stheno to pretend is a vector of vectors. This
#   is helpful to remove some ambiguities that arise if you don't do this.
