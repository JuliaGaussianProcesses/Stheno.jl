# Stheno.jl

Stheno.jl is a package for probabilistic programming with Gaussian processes.

If you've yet to take a look at [AbstractGPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/AbstractGPs.jl), it's best to do so before digging into this package, because this package implements the [Internal AbstractGPs API](https://juliagaussianprocesses.github.io/AbstractGPs.jl/dev/api/#Internal-AbstractGPs-API) for several different concrete subtypes of AbstractGP.
