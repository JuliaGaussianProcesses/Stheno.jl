# Notes on Experimental Examples

These examples comprise things that sit on the edge of what is currently doable using Stheno.jl.
Their purpose is to illustrate that a particular thing is possible to do with a little bit of work, despite it not currently being available as core functionality in Stheno.jl.
For example, they typically involve implementing a new affine transformation, thereby extending the list of operations available for use in Stheno.jl, but they do it in a way that is not completely satisfactory, so it doesn't obviously make sense to include them as basic functionality in the package.

If you are keen to contribute, this is a good place to look for interesting things to add -- probably best to open an issue to discuss how a really solid implementation might look before opening a PR though.
